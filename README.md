# cfwheels-template-helloworld

This is the ubiquitous Hello World application written in CFWheels. 

## As an Application

As an application, this is the most simple app you could build. It consists of a single static page and a route definition to load up that static page as the default page. That's all there is to it.

```
\config
  routes.cfm
\views
  \main
    index.cfm
```

The routes.cfm file tells the framework what view to display as the defaul page. The index.cfm is that page and is located in the main folder inside the views folder. If you look inside the routes.cfm page you'll see a line that identifies the root route and where to send the requst. In this app that is identified as "main##index"". Which basically reads as when the root route is called send the request to the index action of the main controller. The names index and main are arbitrary and could be anything you like as long as the root route setting is updated to reflect the new names the app will continue to function.

## As a Forgbox Package

As a Forgebox package there is some interesting things going on here. The package contains the minimum files needed for this app to work which is basically two folders the config folder and the views folder. Note that in our finall running application both of these folders contain more items and there are a handfull of other folders the framework needs to funciton properly. These folders are pulled in via the two dependencies:

```
    "Dependencies":{
        "cfwheels-core":"^2.2",
        "cfwheels-template-base":"^2.2"
    }
```

The next part of the package that is interesting is that the base files are copied down into a folder called base/, then your package files are copied into the base/ folder, and finally the contents of the base/ folder is copied into the root of your application. This is all acomplished via a script setting in the package:

```
    "scripts":{
        "postInstallAll":"rm base/box.json --force && cp config/ base/config/ --recurse && cp views/ base/views/ --recurse && cp base/ ./ --recurse && rm base/ --recurse --force"
    }
```

This allows us to keep our package limited to just the files needed for our application and allows us to use the package management system provided by Forgebox and Commandbox to pull in the necessary files.

## To install

To install this package you'll need to have a running CommandBox installation. Then you can install this package with the following:

```
box
mkdir cfwheels-helloworld --cd
install cfwheels-template-helloworld
```

This could be shortened to a single command run in an empty directory:

```
box install cfwheels-template-helloworld
```
